# Learning to use Apache Cassandra

I've got a need to learn about running applications in multiple data centers (DC). The biggest barrier I face is how to deal with database servers in various DC's that will not be allowed cross DC network traffic.

I can guarantee the database servers will be granted cross communication but not the applications. Apache Cassandra may be a viable solution to my problem.
